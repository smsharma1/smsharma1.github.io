# Biography
My name is Shubham Sharma and I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering  at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India.  My research interest lies in understanding new technologies in Cyber
Security, Computer Networks and Distributed Systems. During my curriculum I have done various projects and courses on these topics
and I am fascinated by their research prospects. Currently I am working with prof. [Sandeep Shukla](http://www.iitk.ac.in/new/sandeep-k-shukla) on block chain technology. You can find my detailed CV [here](https://smsharma1.github.io/data/CV.pdf)


Apart from academics, I like to spend my time doing wildlife photography, playing badminton and doing social work for conservation of nature.
